<p>Hello my name is <b>Willie Whitfield</b> and I am a front-end web deveoper, welcome to my page</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
As someone who's dabbled in HTML & CSS before, I didn't actually recognize my passion for coding until early 2020. Since then, I have learned and practiced the foundations of web development transforming a slight curiosity into a full blown passion. My background as a Special education teacher has developed my ability to break larger concepts into more digestible segments and my background as a professional athlete and coach has strengthened my problem solving skills and attention to detail. Seeking an early-career position in Front-End Development. Feel free to message me for additional information.
